# Pong

This is a Pong clone that I built to teach myself C#.

Designed in the MonoGame Framework of Visual Studio, I added a randomly occuring ace hit to mix it up a little.

Snells Law was used to determine reflection angles, it was interesting to utilise some of my trigonometric knowlegde to program these.

Playable version in the "Pong" folder.
